 | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels:
 |
 |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,
 |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
 |
 |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven
 |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven
 |                 installation). It's normally provided in
 |                 ${maven.conf}/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
 |
 | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at
 | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default
 | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided.

    </pluginGroups>

    <!-- proxies
     | This is a list of proxies which can be used on this machine to connect to the network.
     | Unless otherwise specified (by system property or command-line switch), the first proxy
     | specification in this list marked as active will be used.

    <!-- servers
     | This is a list of authentication profiles, keyed by the server-id used within the system.
     | Authentication profiles can be used whenever maven must make a connection to a remote server.
     |-->
    <servers>
        <!-- server
         | Specifies the authentication information to use when connecting to a particular server, identified by
         | a unique name within the system (referred to by the 'id' attribute below).
         |
         | NOTE: You should either specify username/password OR privateKey/passphrase, since these pairings are
         |       used together.

    <!-- mirrors
     | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
     |
     | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
     | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
     | it to several places.
     |
     | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
     | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
     | server for that repository.
     |-->
    <mirrors>
        <!-- mirror
         | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that
         | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used
         | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.
         |
